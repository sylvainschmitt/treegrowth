**Variation in the growth potential of individual trees at the Paracou research station.**

We investigated effects of phylogeny and ecological processes on individual growth, using phylogeny, topography and neighbourhood indices.

The individual growth of individual $i$ in species $s$ between individual recruitment $y_0$ and 2020, 
corresponds to the difference of DBH between the two years, and is defined with a hierarchical model in a lognormal distribution as follows:

$$DBH_{y=2017,s,i} - DBH_{y=y0,s,i} \sim logN(log[\sum_{y=y0}^{y=2017}AGR(DBH_{y,s,i})], \sigma^2_1)$$

where the difference of DBH $DBH_{y=2017,p,i}-DBH_{y=y_0,p,i}$ is defined with a lognormal distribution located on the logarithm of the sum of annual growth rates $AGR$ during the period $y_0-2017$ and of shape $\sigma_1$. 
The annual growth rate $AGR$ for individual $i$ in species $s$ at year $y$ with a diameter of $DBH_{y,p,i}$ is defined following a Gompertz model [@Gompertz1825] already identified as the best model for growth-trajectories in Paracou [@Herault2011]:

$$AGR(DBH_{y,s,i}) = Gmax_i.exp(-\frac12[\frac{log(\frac{DBH_{y,p,i}}{Dopt_s})}{Ks_s}]^2)$$

where $Gmax_i$ is the maximum growth potential (maximal AGR during individual life) for individual $i$, 
$Dopt_s$ is the species optimal diameter at which the individual reaches its maximum growth potential, 
and $Ks_s$ is the species kurtosis defining the width of the bell-shaped growth-trajectory [see figure 1 in @Herault2011]. 
To ease model inference, species optimal diameter $Dopt_p$ and kurtosis $Ks_p$ were defined as random population effects centered on a global $Dopt$ and $Ks$ with corresponding variances $\sigma^2_{P,Dopt}$ and $\sigma^2_{P,Ks}$. . 
We used Bayesian inference with No-U-Turn Sampler [NUTS, @Hoffman2014] using `stan` language [@Carpenter2017].
