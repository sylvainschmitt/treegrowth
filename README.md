*Variation in the growth potential of individuals and species as a function of phylogeny, environment and together.  A. The distribution of species growth potential (Median[Gmaxi]) across the phylogeny from slow growing species in dark blue to fast growing species in yellow (log-scale) is phylogenetically structured (Pagelâ€™s =0.72, p<0.001) with a significant positive autocorrelation to a phylogenetic partistic distance below 100 (Fig. S2), corresponding to the genus level (Tab. 1). B. Individual growth potential (Gmaxi) is significantly decreasing with neighbourhood crowding index (NCI, =-0.89, p<0.001, R2=0.109). C. Intraspecific variation in growth potential (CVlog[Gmaxi])) is significantly varying with species growth potential (Median[Gmaxi]), =-1.18, p<0.001, R2=0.146), with reduced intraspecific variation for slow and fast growing species compared to the others.*
