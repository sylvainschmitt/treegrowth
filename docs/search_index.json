The result is summarised in Table 1.1. 1.1 Data I used reduced data to explore the model form. I focused on trees at 20 meters from any plot edges for neighbourhood effect. I used only recruited trees in the censuses with at least 20 measurements of diameter at breast height (DBH, cm). And, I randomly selected 20 trees for lightweight training data. I further selected the last diameter measured for each individual as an evaluation data not used for model fitting (Fig. 1.1). Figure 1.1: Tree diameter trajectories in training data. Color represent individuals and the red point the data used for evaluation. 1.2 Michaelis Menten The first tested model is a Michaelis Menten model using time \\(t\\) since recruitment (DBH=10cm) for each individual tree \\(i\\): \\[DBH_{i,t} \\sim \\mathcal N (10 + \\frac{\\alpha_i \\times t}{\\beta_i+t}, \\sigma)\\] where \\(\\alpha\\) is individual maximum diameter and \\(\\beta\\) the year since recruitment when the individual reaches half the maximum diameter value. The model correctly converged (\\(\\hat R &lt; 1.05\\)) with an acceptable but marked correlation between \\(alpha\\) and \\(beta\\). \\(beta\\) posteriors have not too much uncertainty and are varying widely among individuals. Finally predictions of the diameter trajectories by the model are good. 1.3 Gompertz The second tested model uses a Gompertz model (Hérault et al. 2011), were the diameter of individual \\(i\\) at year \\(t\\) is the individual diameter from previous year plus its annual growth: \\[DBH_{i,s,t} \\sim \\mathcal N (DBH_{i,t-i} + Gmax_i \\times exp(-\\frac12.[\\frac{log(\\frac{DBH_{i,t-i}}{100.Dopt_i})}{Ks_i}]^2)\\times\\Delta t, \\sigma)\\] The annual growth rate for individual \\(i\\) at year \\(y\\) with a diameter of \\(DBH_{y,i}\\) is defined following a Gompertz model (Gompertz 1825) already identified as the best model for growth-trajectories in Paracou (Hérault et al. 2011), where \\(Gmax\\) is the maximum growth potential, \\(Dopt\\) is the optimal diameter at which the individual reaches its maximum growth potential, and \\(Ks\\) is the kurtosis defining the width of the bell-shaped growth-trajectory (see figure 1 in Hérault et al. 2011). On model parameter diverged (\\(\\hat R &gt; 1.05\\)) with no correlations among parameters. \\(gmax\\) posteriors are highly uncertain and does not vary widely among individuals. Finally predictions of the diameter trajectories by the model are overfitting because the model uses the diameter from previous census reporting the measurement error from one year to the other. 1.4 Lognormal The third tested model is a lognormal model using time \\(t\\) since recruitment (DBH=10cm) for each individual tree \\(i\\): \\[DBH_{i,t} \\sim \\mathcal N (10 +\\beta \\times log(t), \\sigma)\\] where \\(\\beta\\) is the slope of year since recruitment effect on the log response of diameter to time. The model correctly converged (\\(\\hat R &lt; 1.05\\)) with no correlations among parameters. \\(beta\\) posteriors have not too much uncertainty and are varying widely among individuals. Finally predictions of the diameter trajectories by the model are a bit far from observations. 1.5 Polynomial The fourth tested model is a third degree polynomial model using time \\(t\\) since recruitment (DBH=10cm) for each individual tree \\(i\\): \\[DBH_{i,t} \\sim \\mathcal N (\\alpha \\times t^3 + \\beta_i \\times t^2+ \\gamma_i \\times t + 10, \\sigma)\\] where \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) are the slope of year since recruitment effects to its cube, square or identity. The model correctly converged (\\(\\hat R &lt; 1.05\\)) with an acceptable but marked correlation between \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\). \\(gamma\\) posteriors have not too much uncertainty and are varying widely among individuals. Finally predictions of the diameter trajectories by the model are a bit overfitted with unrealistic inflections at the end of the trajectories 1.6 Weibul The fifth tested model is a Weibul model using time \\(t\\) since recruitment (DBH=10cm) for each individual tree \\(i\\): \\[DBH_{i,t} \\sim \\mathcal N (10 + \\alpha \\times (1 − e^{-t_i/\\beta}) , \\sigma)\\] The model correctly converged (\\(\\hat R &lt; 1.05\\)) with an acceptable but marked correlation between \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\). \\(beta\\) posteriors have not too much uncertainty and are varying widely among individuals. Finally predictions of the diameter trajectories by the model are good. 1.7 Amani The sixth tested model was developed by Amani et al. (2021) and uses time \\(t\\) since recruitment (DBH=10cm) for each individual tree \\(i\\): \\[DBH_{i,t} \\sim \\mathcal N (\\alpha \\times (1 − e^{-\\lambda \\times (\\frac{t_i}{\\theta})^\\beta}) , \\sigma)\\] The model correctly converged (\\(\\hat R &lt; 1.05\\)) with an acceptable but marked correlation between \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\lambda\\). \\(\\theta\\) posteriors are highly uncertain and does not vary widely among individuals. Finally predictions of the diameter trajectories by the model are good but the inflection point if only used in the yellow trajectory more probably due to a change of POM than real growth change. 1.8 Gompertz sum The seventh tested model uses a Gompertz model (Hérault et al. 2011), were the diameter of individual \\(i\\) at year \\(t\\) is the sum of annual growth from \\(t0\\) to \\(t\\): \\[DBH_{t,i} \\sim \\mathcal N (10 + gmax_i \\times \\sum _{y=1|DBH_{t=0}} ^{y=t} exp(-\\frac12.[\\frac{log(\\frac{DBH_{t,i}}{100.Dopt_i})}{Ks_i}]^2)), \\sigma)\\] The annual growth rate for individual \\(i\\) at year \\(y\\) with a diameter of \\(DBH_{y,i}\\) is defined following a Gompertz model (Gompertz 1825) already identified as the best model for growth-trajectories in Paracou (Hérault et al. 2011), where \\(Gmax\\) is the maximum growth potential, \\(Dopt\\) is the optimal diameter at which the individual reaches its maximum growth potential, and \\(Ks\\) is the kurtosis defining the width of the bell-shaped growth-trajectory (see figure 1 in Hérault et al. 2011). The model correctly converged (\\(\\hat R &lt; 1.05\\)) with an acceptable but marked correlation between \\(dopt\\) and \\(ks\\). \\(gmax\\) posteriors have logical uncertainty but are varying widely among individuals. Finally predictions of the diameter trajectories by the model are good and realistic. Moreover, model errors do not show temporal autocorrelation per individual. 1.9 Comparisons The Gompertz sum model has the best prediction (lowest RMSEP) associated to the second best evaluation (second lowest loo epld), knowing that the first one use every year diameter and overfit, and a decent computing time. This is the best model that I’ll use in next steps.

Current results are using reduced data from chapter 3. 5.1 Methods 5.1.1 Environmental descriptors I used the mean neighbourhood crowding index (\\(NCI\\); Uriarte et al. 2004) over the last 30 years, an indirect measurement of access to light and forest gap dynamics. The mean neighbourhood crowding index \\(NCI_i\\) from tree individual \\(i\\) was calculated as follows: \\[NCI_i=\\overline{\\sum_{j|\\delta_{i,j}&lt;20m}DBH^2_{j,t}.e^{-\\frac14\\delta_{i,j}}}\\] with \\(DBH_{j,t}\\) the diameter of the neighbouring tree \\(j\\) in year \\(t\\) and \\(\\delta_{i,j}\\) its distance to the individual tree \\(i\\). \\(NCI_i\\) is computed for all neighbours at a distance \\(\\delta_{i,j}\\) inferior to the maximum neighbouring distance of 20 meters. The power of neighbours \\(DBH_{j,t}\\) effect was set to 2 to represent a surface. The decrease of neighbours’ diameter effect with distance was set to -0.25 to represent trees at 20 meters of the focal trees having 1% of the effect of the same tree at 0 meters. \\(NCI_i\\) is computed as the mean of yearly \\(NCI_{i,t}\\) over the last 30 years denoted by the overline. I used the topographic wetness index (\\(TWI\\)) as proxies of the distribution of soil water and nutrients in Paracou. Waterlogging and topography have been highlighted as crucial for forest dynamics (Ferry et al. 2010), species-habitat relationships (Engelbrecht et al. 2007), and phenotypic variation (Schmitt et al. 2020). Topography, through the dissolution of iron oxides, litter- and tree-fall transfers and waterlogging, shapes soil nutrient distribution in tropical forests (John et al. 2007; Ferry et al. 2010). TWI was derived from a 1-m-resolution digital elevation model using SAGA-GIS (Conrad et al. 2015) based on a LiDAR campaign of the whole Paracou field station done in 2015. 5.1.2 Analyses To study the effect of phylogeny and environment, we investigated the effects of family, genus, species &amp; topography \\(TWI\\) and neighbourhood \\(NCI\\) indices on individual growth potential \\(Gmax\\) with the following linear mixed model: \\[log(Gmax) ~ \\sim \\mathcal N (\\alpha_{species} + \\beta_{NCI} \\times log(NCI),\\sigma) \\\\ |~ \\alpha_{species} \\sim \\mathcal N(\\alpha_{genus},\\sigma_{species})\\\\ |~ \\alpha_{genus} \\sim \\mathcal N(\\alpha_{family},\\sigma_{genus})\\\\ |~ \\alpha_{family} \\sim \\mathcal N(\\alpha,\\sigma_{family})\\] We reported the corresponding marginal and conditional \\(R^2\\) (Nakagawa &amp; Schielzeth 2013). We further plotted individual growth potential \\(Gmax\\) along environmental gradients and across the phylogeny.

Local indicator of phylogenetic association highlight the conservation of species growth potential at the genus level (Fig. 5.5), as illustrated for instance with fast growing Cecropia opposed to slow growing Eschweilera.

Current results are using full data from chapter 4. 6.1 Methods 6.1.1 Environmental descriptors I used the mean neighbourhood crowding index (\\(NCI\\); Uriarte et al. 2004) over the last 30 years, an indirect measurement of access to light and forest gap dynamics. The mean neighbourhood crowding index \\(NCI_i\\) from tree individual \\(i\\) was calculated as follows: \\[NCI_i=\\overline{\\sum_{j|\\delta_{i,j}&lt;20m}DBH^2_{j,t}.e^{-\\frac14\\delta_{i,j}}}\\] with \\(DBH_{j,t}\\) the diameter of the neighbouring tree \\(j\\) in year \\(t\\) and \\(\\delta_{i,j}\\) its distance to the individual tree \\(i\\). \\(NCI_i\\) is computed for all neighbours at a distance \\(\\delta_{i,j}\\) inferior to the maximum neighbouring distance of 20 meters. The power of neighbours \\(DBH_{j,t}\\) effect was set to 2 to represent a surface. The decrease of neighbours’ diameter effect with distance was set to -0.25 to represent trees at 20 meters of the focal trees having 1% of the effect of the same tree at 0 meters. \\(NCI_i\\) is computed as the mean of yearly \\(NCI_{i,t}\\) over the last 30 years denoted by the overline. I used the topographic wetness index (\\(TWI\\)) as proxies of the distribution of soil water and nutrients in Paracou. Waterlogging and topography have been highlighted as crucial for forest dynamics (Ferry et al. 2010), species-habitat relationships (Engelbrecht et al. 2007), and phenotypic variation (Schmitt et al. 2020). Topography, through the dissolution of iron oxides, litter- and tree-fall transfers and waterlogging, shapes soil nutrient distribution in tropical forests (John et al. 2007; Ferry et al. 2010). TWI was derived from a 1-m-resolution digital elevation model using SAGA-GIS (Conrad et al. 2015) based on a LiDAR campaign of the whole Paracou field station done in 2015. 6.1.2 Analyses To study the effect of phylogeny and environment, we investigated the effects of family, genus, species &amp; topography \\(TWI\\) and neighbourhood \\(NCI\\) indices on individual growth potential \\(Gmax\\) with the following linear mixed model: \\[log(Gmax) ~ \\sim \\mathcal N (\\alpha_{species} + \\beta_{NCI} \\times log(NCI),\\sigma) \\\\ |~ \\alpha_{species} \\sim \\mathcal N(\\alpha_{genus},\\sigma_{species})\\\\ |~ \\alpha_{genus} \\sim \\mathcal N(\\alpha_{family},\\sigma_{genus})\\\\ |~ \\alpha_{family} \\sim \\mathcal N(\\alpha,\\sigma_{family})\\] We reported the corresponding marginal and conditional \\(R^2\\) (Nakagawa &amp; Schielzeth 2013). We further plotted individual growth potential \\(Gmax\\) along environmental gradients and across the phylogeny.
