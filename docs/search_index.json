We investigated effects of phylogeny and ecological processes on individual growth, using phylogeny, topography and neighbourhood indices. The individual growth of individual \\(i\\) in species \\(s\\) between individual recruitment \\(y_0\\) and 2020, corresponds to the difference of DBH between the two years, and is defined with a hierarchical model in a lognormal distribution as follows: \\[DBH_{y=2020,s,i} - DBH_{y=y0,s,i} \\sim logN(log[Gmax_s \\times \\sum_{y=y0}^{y=2020} exp(-\\frac12[\\frac{log(\\frac{DBH_{y,p,i}}{Dopt_s})}{Ks_s}]^2)], \\sigma^2)\\] where the difference of DBH \\(DBH_{y=2017,p,i}-DBH_{y=y_0,p,i}\\) is defined with a lognormal distribution located on the logarithm of the sum of annual growth rates \\(AGR\\) during the period \\(y_0-2017\\) and of shape \\(\\sigma\\). The annual growth rate \\(AGR\\) for individual \\(i\\) in species \\(s\\) at year \\(y\\) with a diameter of \\(DBH_{y,p,i}\\) is defined following a Gompertz model (Gompertz 1825) already identified as the best model for growth-trajectories in Paracou (Hérault et al. 2011), where \\(Gmax_s\\) is the maximum growth potential for species \\(s\\), \\(Dopt_s\\) is the species optimal diameter at which the individual reaches its maximum growth potential, and \\(Ks_s\\) is the species kurtosis defining the width of the bell-shaped growth-trajectory (see figure 1 in Hérault et al. 2011). We used Bayesian inference with No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS, Hoffman &amp; Gelman 2014) using stan language (Carpenter et al. 2017). The maximum growth \\(Gmax\\) for individual \\(i\\) in species \\(s\\) can be computed based on the difference between species predicted diameter and observed diameter in 2020: \\[Gmax_i = \\frac{DBH_{y=2020,s,i}}{\\sum_{y=y0}^{y=2020} exp(-\\frac12[\\frac{log(\\frac{DBH_{y,p,i}}{Dopt_s})}{Ks_s}]^2)}\\] We used the mean neighbourhood crowding index (\\(NCI\\); Uriarte et al. 2004) over the last 30 years, an indirect measurement of access to light and forest gap dynamics. The mean neighbourhood crowding index \\(NCI_i\\) from tree individual \\(i\\) was calculated as follows: \\[NCI_i=\\overline{\\sum_{j|\\delta_{i,j}&lt;20m}DBH^2_{j,t}.e^{-\\frac14\\delta_{i,j}}}\\] with \\(DBH_{j,t}\\) the diameter of the neighbouring tree \\(j\\) in year \\(t\\) and \\(\\delta_{i,j}\\) its distance to the individual tree \\(i\\). \\(NCI_i\\) is computed for all neighbours at a distance \\(\\delta_{i,j}\\) inferior to the maximum neighbouring distance of 20 meters. The power of neighbours \\(DBH_{j,t}\\) effect was set to 2 to represent a surface. The decrease of neighbours’ diameter effect with distance was set to -0.25 to represent trees at 20 meters of the focal trees having 1% of the effect of the same tree at 0 meters. \\(NCI_i\\) is computed as the mean of yearly \\(NCI_{i,t}\\) over the last 30 years denoted by the overline. We used the topographic wetness index (\\(TWI\\)) as proxies of the distribution of soil water and nutrients in Paracou. Waterlogging and topography have been highlighted as crucial for forest dynamics (Ferry et al. 2010), species-habitat relationships (Engelbrecht et al. 2007), and phenotypic variation [Schmitt et al. (2020)). Topography, through the dissolution of iron oxides, litter- and tree-fall transfers and waterlogging, shapes soil nutrient distribution in tropical forests (Ferry et al. 2010; John et al. 2007). TWI was derived from a 1-m-resolution digital elevation model using SAGA-GIS (Conrad et al. 2015) based on a LiDAR campaign of the whole Paracou field station done in 2015. To study the effect of phylogeny and environment, we investigated the effects of family, genus, species &amp; topography \\(TWI\\) and neighbourhood \\(NCI\\) indices on individual growth \\(Gmax\\) with the following linear mixed model: \\[log(Gmax) ~ \\sim \\mathcal N (\\alpha_{species} + \\beta_{NCI} \\times log(NCI),\\sigma) \\\\ |~ \\alpha_{species} \\sim \\mathcal N(\\alpha_{genus},\\sigma_{species})\\\\ |~ \\alpha_{genus} \\sim \\mathcal N(\\alpha_{family},\\sigma_{genus})\\\\ |~ \\alpha_{family} \\sim \\mathcal N(\\alpha,\\sigma_{family})\\] References "],["model-choice.html", "Chapter 1 Model choice 1.1 Data 1.2 Michaelis Menten 1 1.3 Michaelis Menten 2 1.4 Gompertz 1.5 Lognormal 1.6 Polynomial 1.7 Weibul 1.8 Amani 1.9 Gompertz sum 1.10 Gompertz sum 2 1.11 Comparisons", " Chapter 1 Model choice In this chapter we looked for the best model shape based on quality of fit, cross-validation (LOO), and prediction (RMSEP). 1.1 Data 1.2 Michaelis Menten 1 Using time \\(t\\) since recruitment (DBH=10cm) for each individual tree \\(i\\): \\[DBH_{i,t} \\sim \\mathcal N (10 + \\frac{\\alpha_i \\times t}{\\beta_i+t}, \\sigma)\\] 1.3 Michaelis Menten 2 Using time \\(t\\) since recruitment (DBH=10cm) for each individual tree \\(i\\): \\[DBH_{i,t} \\sim \\mathcal N (10 + \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\alpha_i} + \\frac{1}{\\gamma_i \\times t}}, \\sigma)\\] 1.4 Gompertz Using time \\(t\\) since recruitment (DBH=10cm) for each individual tree \\(i\\): \\[DBH_{i,s,t} \\sim \\mathcal N (DBH_{i,t-i} + Gmax_i \\times exp(-\\frac12.[\\frac{log(\\frac{DBH_{i,t-i}}{100.Dopt_i})}{Ks_i}]^2)\\times\\Delta t, \\sigma)\\] 1.5 Lognormal Using time \\(t\\) since recruitment (DBH=10cm) for each individual tree \\(i\\): \\[DBH_{i,t} \\sim \\mathcal N (10 +\\beta \\times log(t), \\sigma)\\] 1.6 Polynomial Using time \\(t\\) since recruitment (DBH=10cm) for each individual tree \\(i\\): \\[DBH_{i,t} \\sim \\mathcal N (\\alpha \\times t^3 + \\beta_i \\times t^2+ \\gamma_i \\times t + 10, \\sigma)\\] 1.7 Weibul Using time \\(t\\) since recruitment (DBH=10cm) for each individual tree \\(i\\): \\[DBH_{i,t} \\sim \\mathcal N (10 + \\alpha \\times (1 − e^{-t_i/\\beta}) , \\sigma)\\] 1.8 Amani Using time \\(t\\) since recruitment (DBH=10cm) for each individual tree \\(i\\): \\[DBH_{i,t} \\sim \\mathcal N (\\alpha \\times (1 − e^{-\\lambda \\times (\\frac{t_i}{\\theta})^\\beta}) , \\sigma)\\] 1.9 Gompertz sum Using time \\(t\\) since recruitment (DBH=10cm) for each individual tree \\(i\\): \\[ DBH_{t,i} \\sim \\mathcal N (10 + gmax_i \\times \\sum _{y=0} ^{y=t} exp(-\\frac12.[\\frac{log(\\frac{DBH_{t,i}}{100.Dopt_i})}{Ks_i}]^2)), \\sigma)\\] 1.10 Gompertz sum 2 Using time \\(t\\) since recruitment (DBH=10cm) for each individual tree \\(i\\): \\[ DBH_{t,i} \\sim \\mathcal N (10 + gmax_i \\times \\sum _{y=0} ^{y=t} exp(-\\frac12.[\\frac{log(\\frac{DBH_{t,i}}{100.Dopt_i})}{Ks_i}]^2)), \\sigma)\\] 1.11 Comparisons elpd_diff se_diff elpd_loo se_elpd_loo p_loo se_p_loo looic se_looic Gompertz 0.000000 0.000000 252.5768 5.297475 3.707155 0.1762043 -505.1535 10.59495 Gompertz sum 2 -3.736661 5.576073 248.8401 5.114695 4.670876 0.1768954 -497.6802 10.22939 Gompertz sum -14.808735 5.659101 237.7680 5.346394 4.706502 0.1766864 -475.5360 10.69279 Polynomial -24.480108 5.929703 228.0967 5.071009 5.276272 0.1798597 -456.1933 10.14202 Michaelis Menten 2 -26.205735 6.521274 226.3710 5.386964 3.609515 0.1349292 -452.7420 10.77393 Lognormal -28.691175 7.186175 223.8856 5.273457 2.125079 0.0730310 -447.7712 10.54691 Michaelis Menten 1 -38.408940 7.045362 214.1678 5.445341 2.822001 0.0934159 -428.3356 10.89068 "],["analyses.html", "Chapter 2 Analyses", " Chapter 2 Analyses In this chapter we … "],["references.html", "References", " References "]]
