Sylvain "],["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Variation in the growth potential of individual trees at the Paracou research station. We investigated effects of phylogeny and ecological processes on individual growth, using phylogeny, topography and neighbourhood indices. The individual growth of individual \\(i\\) in species \\(s\\) between individual recruitment \\(y_0\\) and 2020, corresponds to the difference of DBH between the two years, and is defined with a hierarchical model in a lognormal distribution as follows: \\[DBH_{y=2020,s,i} - DBH_{y=y0,s,i} \\sim logN(log[\\sum_{y=y0}^{y=2020}AGR(DBH_{y,s,i})], \\sigma^2)\\] where the difference of DBH \\(DBH_{y=2017,p,i}-DBH_{y=y_0,p,i}\\) is defined with a lognormal distribution located on the logarithm of the sum of annual growth rates \\(AGR\\) during the period \\(y_0-2017\\) and of shape \\(\\sigma\\). The annual growth rate \\(AGR\\) for individual \\(i\\) in species \\(s\\) at year \\(y\\) with a diameter of \\(DBH_{y,p,i}\\) is defined following a Gompertz model (Gompertz 1825) already identified as the best model for growth-trajectories in Paracou (Hérault et al. 2011): \\[AGR(DBH_{y,s,i}) = Gmax_s.exp(-\\frac12[\\frac{log(\\frac{DBH_{y,p,i}}{Dopt_s})}{Ks_s}]^2)\\] where \\(Gmax_s\\) is the maximum growth potential for species \\(s\\), \\(Dopt_s\\) is the species optimal diameter at which the individual reaches its maximum growth potential, and \\(Ks_s\\) is the species kurtosis defining the width of the bell-shaped growth-trajectory (see figure 1 in Hérault et al. 2011). We used Bayesian inference with No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS, Hoffman &amp; Gelman 2014) using stan language (Carpenter et al. 2017). The maximum growth \\(Gmax\\) for individual \\(i\\) in species \\(s\\) can be computed based on the difference between species predicted diameter and observed diameter in 2020: \\[Gmax_i = Gmax_s + DBH_{y=2020,s,i} - \\hat{DBH_{y=2020,s}}\\] To study the phylogenetic signal of individual growth potential \\(Gmax_i\\), we used Blomberg’s K and variance partitioning across individuals, species, genera, and families. We used the mean neighbourhood crowding index (\\(NCI\\); Uriarte et al. 2004) over the last 30 years, an indirect measurement of access to light and forest gap dynamics. The mean neighbourhood crowding index \\(NCI_i\\) from tree individual \\(i\\) was calculated as follows: \\[NCI_i=\\overline{\\sum_{j|\\delta_{i,j}&lt;20m}DBH^2_{j,t}.e^{-\\frac14\\delta_{i,j}}}\\] with \\(DBH_{j,t}\\) the diameter of the neighbouring tree \\(j\\) in year \\(t\\) and \\(\\delta_{i,j}\\) its distance to the individual tree \\(i\\). \\(NCI_i\\) is computed for all neighbours at a distance \\(\\delta_{i,j}\\) inferior to the maximum neighbouring distance of 20 meters. The power of neighbours \\(DBH_{j,t}\\) effect was set to 2 to represent a surface. The decrease of neighbours’ diameter effect with distance was set to -0.25 to represent trees at 20 meters of the focal trees having 1% of the effect of the same tree at 0 meters. \\(NCI_i\\) is computed as the mean of yearly \\(NCI_{i,t}\\) over the last 30 years denoted by the overline. We used the topographic wetness index (\\(TWI\\)) as proxies of the distribution of soil water and nutrients in Paracou. Waterlogging and topography have been highlighted as crucial for forest dynamics (Ferry et al. 2010), species-habitat relationships (Engelbrecht et al. 2007), and phenotypic variation [Schmitt et al. (2020)). Topography, through the dissolution of iron oxides, litter- and tree-fall transfers and waterlogging, shapes soil nutrient distribution in tropical forests (Ferry et al. 2010; John et al. 2007). TWI was derived from a 1-m-resolution digital elevation model using SAGA-GIS (Conrad et al. 2015) based on a LiDAR campaign of the whole Paracou field station done in 2015. To investigate effects of topography and neighbourhood indices on individual growth we used variance partitioning with linear models. Maybe add a joint analyses of phylogeny and ecological processes with a linear mixed model.

We used the full Guyafor database that we recoded in SQL for faster quesry using dbplyr. We focused on the variation in diameter of trees across censuses in the P6 (Fig. 1.1). We chose to keep individuals with at least 10 censuses and species with at least 10 individuals (Fig. 1.2). To gain time, we further reduced the dataset to 187 trees over 37 years and 3 species in the plot 14 of Paracou. load(&quot;data/Guyafor_Bota.RData&quot;) vroom::vroom_write(Guyafor, &quot;data/guyafor.csv&quot;, delim = &quot;,&quot;) csv2sql::csv_to_sqlite(csv_name = &quot;data/guyafor.csv&quot;, db_name = &quot;data/guyafor.sql&quot;, table_name = &quot;inventory&quot;) unlink(&quot;data/guyafor.csv&quot;) Figure 1.1: Plot 6 inventories through cenususes.
