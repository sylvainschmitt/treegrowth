The individual growth of individual \\(i\\) in species \\(s\\) between individual recruitment \\(y_0\\) and 2020, corresponds to the difference of DBH between the two years, and is defined with a hierarchical model in a lognormal distribution as follows: \\[DBH_{y=2017,s,i} - DBH_{y=y0,s,i} \\sim logN(log[\\sum_{y=y0}^{y=2017}AGR(DBH_{y,s,i})], \\sigma^2_1)\\] where the difference of DBH \\(DBH_{y=2017,p,i}-DBH_{y=y_0,p,i}\\) is defined with a lognormal distribution located on the logarithm of the sum of annual growth rates \\(AGR\\) during the period \\(y_0-2017\\) and of shape \\(\\sigma_1\\). The annual growth rate \\(AGR\\) for individual \\(i\\) in species \\(s\\) at year \\(y\\) with a diameter of \\(DBH_{y,p,i}\\) is defined following a Gompertz model (Gompertz 1825) already identified as the best model for growth-trajectories in Paracou (Hérault et al. 2011): \\[AGR(DBH_{y,s,i}) = Gmax_i.exp(-\\frac12[\\frac{log(\\frac{DBH_{y,p,i}}{Dopt_s})}{Ks_s}]^2)\\] where \\(Gmax_i\\) is the maximum growth potential (maximal AGR during individual life) for individual \\(i\\), \\(Dopt_s\\) is the species optimal diameter at which the individual reaches its maximum growth potential, and \\(Ks_s\\) is the species kurtosis defining the width of the bell-shaped growth-trajectory (see figure 1 in Hérault et al. 2011). To ease model inference, species optimal diameter \\(Dopt_p\\) and kurtosis \\(Ks_p\\) were defined as random population effects centered on a global \\(Dopt\\) and \\(Ks\\) with corresponding variances \\(\\sigma^2_{P,Dopt}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_{P,Ks}\\). . We used Bayesian inference with No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS, Hoffman &amp; Gelman 2014) using stan language (Carpenter et al. 2017). We thus used the following growth model with a lognormal distribution to estimate individual growth potential: \\[\\begin{equation} DBH_{y=today,s,i} - DBH_{y=y0,s,i} \\sim \\\\ \\mathcal{logN} (log(\\sum _{y=y_0} ^{y=today} \\theta_{1,s,i}.exp(-\\frac12.[\\frac{log(\\frac{DBH_{y,s,i}}{100.\\theta_{2,s}})}{\\theta_{3,s}}]^2)), \\sigma_1) \\\\ \\theta_{1,s,i} \\sim \\mathcal {logN}(log(\\theta_{1,s}), \\sigma_2) \\\\ \\theta_{2,s} \\sim \\mathcal {logN}(log(\\theta_2),\\sigma_3) \\\\ \\theta_{3,s} \\sim \\mathcal {logN}(log(\\theta_3),\\sigma_4) \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] In stan, we fitted the equivalent model with the following priors: \\[\\begin{equation} DBH_{y=today,s,i} - DBH_{y=y0,s,i} \\sim \\\\ \\mathcal{logN} (log(\\sum _{y=y_0} ^{y=today} \\hat{\\theta_{1,s,i}}.exp(-\\frac12.[\\frac{log(\\frac{DBH_{y,s,i}}{100.\\hat{\\theta_{2,s}}})}{\\hat{\\theta_{3,s}}}]^2)), \\sigma_1) \\\\ \\hat{\\theta_{1,s,i}} = e^{log(\\theta_{1,s}) + \\sigma_2.\\epsilon_{1,i}} \\\\ \\hat{\\theta_{2,s}} = e^{log(\\theta_2) + \\sigma_3.\\epsilon_{2,s}} \\\\ \\hat{\\theta_{3,s}} = e^{log(\\theta_3) + \\sigma_4.\\epsilon_{3,s}} \\\\ \\epsilon_{1,i} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1) \\\\ \\epsilon_{2,p} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1) \\\\ \\epsilon_{3,p} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1) \\\\ ~ \\\\ (\\theta_{1,p}, \\theta_2, \\theta_3) \\sim \\mathcal{logN}^3(log(1),1) \\\\ (\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4) \\sim \\mathcal{N}^4_T(0,1) \\\\ \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] References "],["taxonomy.html", "Chapter 3 Taxonomy", " Chapter 3 Taxonomy "],["environment.html", "Chapter 4 Environment", " Chapter 4 Environment "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 5 Conclusion", " Chapter 5 Conclusion "],["references.html", "References", " References "]]
