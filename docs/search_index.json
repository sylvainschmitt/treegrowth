Sylvain "],["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Variation in the growth potential of individual trees at the Paracou research station. We investigated effects of phylogeny and ecological processes on individual growth, using phylogeny, topography and neighbourhood indices. The individual growth of individual \\(i\\) in species \\(s\\) between individual recruitment \\(y_0\\) and 2020, corresponds to the difference of DBH between the two years, and is defined with a hierarchical model in a lognormal distribution as follows: \\[DBH_{y=2017,s,i} - DBH_{y=y0,s,i} \\sim logN(log[\\sum_{y=y0}^{y=2017}AGR(DBH_{y,s,i})], \\sigma^2_1)\\] where the difference of DBH \\(DBH_{y=2017,p,i}-DBH_{y=y_0,p,i}\\) is defined with a lognormal distribution located on the logarithm of the sum of annual growth rates \\(AGR\\) during the period \\(y_0-2017\\) and of shape \\(\\sigma_1\\). The annual growth rate \\(AGR\\) for individual \\(i\\) in species \\(s\\) at year \\(y\\) with a diameter of \\(DBH_{y,p,i}\\) is defined following a Gompertz model (Gompertz 1825) already identified as the best model for growth-trajectories in Paracou (Hérault et al. 2011): \\[AGR(DBH_{y,s,i}) = Gmax_i.exp(-\\frac12[\\frac{log(\\frac{DBH_{y,p,i}}{Dopt_s})}{Ks_s}]^2)\\] where \\(Gmax_i\\) is the maximum growth potential (maximal AGR during individual life) for individual \\(i\\), \\(Dopt_s\\) is the species optimal diameter at which the individual reaches its maximum growth potential, and \\(Ks_s\\) is the species kurtosis defining the width of the bell-shaped growth-trajectory (see figure 1 in Hérault et al. 2011). To ease model inference, species optimal diameter \\(Dopt_p\\) and kurtosis \\(Ks_p\\) were defined as random population effects centered on a global \\(Dopt\\) and \\(Ks\\) with corresponding variances \\(\\sigma^2_{P,Dopt}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_{P,Ks}\\). . We used Bayesian inference with No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS, Hoffman &amp; Gelman 2014) using stan language (Carpenter et al. 2017). Phylogenetic analyses description. NCI description. TWI description.

We used the full Guyafor database that we recoded in SQL for faster quesry using dbplyr. We focused on the variation in diameter of trees across censuses in the P6 (Fig. 1.1). We chose to keep individuals with at least 10 censuses and species with at least 10 individuals (Fig. 1.2). To gain time, we further reduced the dataset to 187 trees over 37 years and 3 species in the plot 14 of Paracou. load(&quot;data/Guyafor_Bota.RData&quot;) vroom::vroom_write(Guyafor, &quot;data/guyafor.csv&quot;, delim = &quot;,&quot;) csv2sql::csv_to_sqlite(csv_name = &quot;data/guyafor.csv&quot;, db_name = &quot;data/guyafor.sql&quot;, table_name = &quot;inventory&quot;) unlink(&quot;data/guyafor.csv&quot;) Figure 1.1: Plot 6 inventories through cenususes.
